Why did I fork this?
Ever since mojang released the firework system, I've been afraid that it'll lag when used. Then I saw a reddit post about this plugin, and it seemed like the perfect solution. 

However, it wasn't perfect for my needs, so I forked it and made a clean version that is. It should be more efficient performance-wise, too.
