## FlyHook
a Modified version of an amazing idea - FlyHook - originally by MagmaGuy.
Remember, ALL credits go to him/her, not me.

###### Why did I fork this?  
Ever since mojang released the firework system, I've been afraid that it'll lag when used. Then I saw a reddit post about this plugin, and it seemed like the perfect solution. 

However, it wasn't perfect for my needs, so I forked it and made a clean version that is. It should be more efficient performance-wise, too.  

Same license as the original FlyHook, if it has one. Otherwise, free to copy, use and do whatever comes to your mind.  
Note though, MagmaGuy holds the idea of this plugin and has already posted the original one to Spigot resources. We don't want duplicates there, so please don't compile & upload this there.

Major differences:  
- Added a config.  
- Almost complete re-write..  
- Added an option to disable firework boosts.
- I have a different name

Configurable options:  
- Strength of the boost  
- Disabling of fireworks  
- Max hooking range  
- Enabling of critical system  

Usage:  
1. Make sure you're gliding & holding a fishing rod.  
2. Right click at the target block you want to hook. (Max radius is configurable)  
3. Wee!
    
Permissions:  
- flyhook.use: Allows the user to boost via fishing rods  
- flyhook.allowfireworks: Allows the user to use the fireworks even when they're disabled
- flyhook.reload: Reloads the config.
